          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>
          <p>The analysis above is based on data from the 2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). BRFSS
            is a collaborative project between all of the states in
            the United States and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
            (CDC).
            The BRFSS is administered and supported by CDC's Population Health Surveillance Branch. It
            is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioral risk factors for the non-institutionalized
            adult
            population (aged 18 years of age and older) residing in the United States. </p>

          <p>The BRFSS questionaire is administered annually and consists of three core components: </p>

          <ol>
            <li> Core component: A standard set of questions that all states use. Core content includes queries about
              current health-related perceptions, conditions, and behaviors (e.g., health status, health care access,
              alcohol consumption, tobacco use, cancer screenings, HIV/AIDS risks), as well as demographic
              questions. The core component includes the annual core comprising questions asked each year, and
              rotating core questions that are included in even- and oddâ€“numbered years.</li>
            <li> Optional BRFSS modules: Sets of questions on specific topics (e.g., excess sun exposure, cancer
              survivorship, mental illness, stigma) that states elect to use on their questionnaires.</li>
            <li> State-added questions: Individual states develop or acquire these questions and add them to their
              BRFSS questionnaires. CDC neither edits nor evaluates these questions.</li>
          </ol>
