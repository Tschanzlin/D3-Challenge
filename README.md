# D3-Challenge

Notes:
- This should correctly on launching; however, if not, please refresh screen and it shoudl load properly.  I started to have general problems with my internet browser that affected the live server loading correctly on the initial launch.
- Changes to incorporate in the future:  (1) try to simplify code; this seems overly complex.  (2) Try to add a state level data chart to the side of the graph or paragraph that fills with the selected state level information


10/5:
- Add third variable to x- and y-axes
- Formatting HTML to center information below chart and add padding; updated descriptive information on data source
- Cleaning code

10/4:
- Created scatter chart with basic functionality - plotted static Poverty vs. Obesity) with tooltip enabled
- Incorporated dynamic x-axis, adding two variables that can be selected (Poverty or Age)
- Incorporated dynamic y-axis, adding obesity and smokes variables
